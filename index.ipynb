        "\n",
        "The visualization of high-dimensional data is a key task in countless domains of scientific research. \n",
        "Yet, the representation of multi-dimensional data in a two-dimensional canvas (e.g., static screens or paper) can pose a significant challenge, leading to substantial information loss or distortions, which, in turn, can skew the interpretation and analysis of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a novel approach for visualizing 4D compositional data on a 2D canvas.\n",
        "Compositional data consists of vectors with strictly positive entries that sum to one [@Greenacre2021]. This data type naturally arises for proportions, normalized data, or discrete probabilities.\n",
        "Examples for compositional data include (i) the relative composition of the gut microbiome [@Gloor2017]; (ii) proportion of peoples' activities throughout the day (e.g., activity, rest, and sleep; [@Dumuid2020]; or (iii) discrete probability vectors, such as posterior model probabilities arising in Bayesian model comparison [@PhilipDawid2011; @schmitt2023metauncertainty].\n",
        "\n",
        "Our technique, which we call *simplex projection*, is a lossless visualization method that accurately represents the compositional data while preserving its geometrical and topological properties. \n",
        "We prove mathematically that our mapping from 4D compositional data to its 2D representation is a bijection (invertible one-to-one correspondence) that incurs no loss of information.\n",
        "We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting the simplex projection as a potent tool for exploring and analyzing 4D compositional data.\n",
        "While the underlying mathematical treatment holds for arbitrary finite dimensions, throughout the paper, we will focus chiefly on illustrations and intuitions for the 4D case.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Preliminaries {#sec-preliminaries}\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this manuscript, let $J\\in\\mathbb{N}$, and the points $v_1, \\ldots, v_J\\in\\mathbb{R}^J$ be affinely independent, that is, $(v_2-v_1), \\ldots, (v_j-v_1)$ are linearly independent.\n",
        "Further, the points $v_1, \\ldots, v_J$ are the vertices of the $(J-1)$-dimensional simplex $\\Delta^{J-1}$ defined by the set\n",

        "When the dimension of the simplex $\\Delta^{J-1}$ is sufficiently clear from the context, we drop the superscript and simply write $\\Delta$.\n",
        "\n",
        "The representation of a point $x$ through weighted vertices, that is, via coefficients $(\\pi_1,\\ldots,\\pi_J)$ in @eq-simplex-definition, is commonly referred to as *barycentric coordinates* with respect to the vertices $v_1, \\ldots, v_J$.\n",
        "For brevity, we will slightly overload the notation and use the vector of barycentric coordinates $(\\pi_1, \\ldots, \\pi_J)$ to refer to a point $x=\\sum_{j=1}^J\\pi_j\\,v_j$ in the simplex with vertices $v_1,\\ldots,v_J$ as defined in @eq-simplex-definition.\n",
        "Since any two simplices of equal dimension $J$ are homeomorphic by a simplicial homeomorphism [@lee_introduction_2000], the exact location of the vertices $v_1, \\ldots, v_J$ is irrelevant and we will use regular (aka. equilateral) simplices for all illustrations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The convex hull of each non-empty subset of size $N$ from the $J$ vertices $v_1,\\ldots,v_J$ of a simplex $\\Delta^{J-1}$ is called a $(N-1)$-face.\n",
        "In particular, the $0$-faces are the vertices, the $1$-faces are the edges, the $(J-2)$-faces are the facets which we denote as $\\sigma$, and the only $(J-1)$-face is the simplex $\\Delta^{J-1}$ itself. \n",

        "## Conclusion\n",
        "Current visualization techniques for compositional data on a 2D canvas are either (i) limited to 3D data (simplex plots); or (ii) they fail to express structures across dimensions, such as correlations (parallel coordinates, stacked plots).\n",
        "In this work, we overcome the limited expressiveness (i) of simplex plots while preserving the structure capturing property (ii).\n",
        "Exploiting the inherent structure of compositional data, we proposed a mathematically sound perspective projection approach which corresponds to visualizing marginal densities in statistics.\n",
        "The resulting visualization enjoys the remarkable property that the original joint data distribution can be reconstructed without loss of information, which we proved mathematically.\n",
        "While our mathematical proof holds for an arbitrary number of dimensions, we focused our novel visualization method to representing 4D compositional data on a 2D canvas.\n",
        "Future research can aim to push the envelope and propose structure- and information-preserving visualizations for higher-dimensional compositional data on a low-dimensional canvas.\n",
